# Vue Application Project - Our Expectations

These were our expectations for the Vue application project:

## Overview
We were tasked with developing a complete application using Vue based on our own ideas. The application was expected to be similar in scope to TodoMVC or slightly larger.

## Requirements for Grade G

### Functionality
- Our app needed to be similar in size to TodoMVC or slightly larger
- We were encouraged to use example/starter data from a separate JSON file or external API if needed
- We were advised to avoid functionality requiring extensive user data input

### Testing
- We had to include 3-10 GUI tests using Playwright

### JavaScript
- We were required to use Vue (with React allowed as an alternative)
- TypeScript was optional
- Use of other libraries/frameworks required approval

### CSS
- We had to write CSS from scratch (no frameworks like Bootstrap allowed)
- Our design needed to be responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- We were expected to create an original graphic design (we could use free fonts/images)

### HTML
- We had to write HTML from scratch
- We were expected to use semantic HTML where appropriate

### Code Style
- We needed to maintain consistent indentation and formatting
- We were expected to use clear naming conventions
- We had to include appropriate comments
- We needed to have a reasonable function/class division

### Documentation
- We had to write individual documentation (max 750 words for G, 1500 for VG)
- Our documentation needed to address challenges, aspects we were proud of, and potential improvements

### Video Presentation
- We were required to create a 5-10 minute demo of our application's functionality

## Additional Requirements for Grade VG

- We needed to save user data in localStorage
- We had to implement diagram/graphic functionality using SVG or Canvas
- We weren't allowed to use libraries for SVG/Canvas implementation

## Submission
We were expected to submit:
- A GitHub Pages link
- A ZIP archive with all files (including Playwright tests)
- A video presentation (MP4 format)
- Individual documentation (PDF)

## Collaboration
We were required to work in pairs, but produce individual documentation.

## Grading
We understood that grading would be a holistic assessment based on meeting requirements and code quality.
